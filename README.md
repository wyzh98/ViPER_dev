ViPER is a neural framework for visibility-based pursuit-evasion, where agents cooperatively search for worst-case evaders.
A team of agents methodically explores and clears the entire environment by expanding frontiers, turning all contaminated areas (white) into cleared ones (green).

## Setup instructions

Use conda and pip to setup environments:

```bash
conda create -n viper python=3.11 scikit-image imageio tensorboard matplotlib pytorch pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y
conda activate viper
pip install ray wandb opencv-python-headless
```

## Evaluation

### Download pretrained model and dataset

```bash
bash ./utils/download.sh
```

Set appropriate parameters in `test_parameter.py` and run `test_driver.py` to evaluate.

### Interactive demo

You can also create your own map by running `viper_demo.py`, which opens a canvas for you to draw on.

- Use **Obstacle** and **Free Space** brushes to draw your map. Adjust the brush size with the thickness slider.
- Click **Reset** to clear the canvas, setting it entirely to obstacles or free space.
- Click **Random Map** to load a random map from test map dataset.
- Click **Place Agents** to place multiple agents in the free space.
- Click **Play** to observe how ViPER agents plan their paths. The canvas will close and the interactive demo will play automatically.

Alternatively, you can save the map that you created.

- Click **Start Position** to place the starting position of agents.
- Click **Save Map** before closing the canvas. Your map will be saved as `maps_spec/map.png`. 

## Training

Make sure you have downloaded the map dataset.
Set appropriate parameters in `parameter.py` and run `driver.py` to train the model.
